current_health(

  health_score_factor,
  health_score_cap = "Default",
  health_score_collar = "Default",
  reliability_factor = "Default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_health_score}{Numeric. The output from the function
\code{\link{initial_health}}().}

\item{health_score_factor}{Numeric. E.g. output from the function
\code{\link{health_score_excl_ehv_132kv_tf}}().}

\item{health_score_cap}{Numeric. Specifies the maximum value of current
health score. The cap is used in situations where a good result from a
condition inspection or measurement implies that the health score should
be no more than the specified value. The cap is derived as the minimum
of the observed condition cap and the measured condition cap.
Measured and observed condition caps are found in lookup tables depending
in the asset category, when determine the observed and measured
condition factors. A setting of \code{"Default"} sets the
\code{health_score_cap} to 10.}

\item{health_score_collar}{Numeric. Specifies the minimum value of
Current Health Score.
The collar is used in situations where a poor result from a condition
inspection or measurement implies that the health score should be at
least the specified value.
The collar is derived as the minimum of the observed condition collar
and the measured condition collar. Measured and observed condition
collars are found in lookup tables depending in the asset category,
when determine the observed and measured condition factors.
A setting of \code{"Default"} sets the \code{health_score_collar} to 0.5.}

\item{reliability_factor}{Numeric. \code{reliability_factor}
shall have a value between 0.6 and 1.5. A setting of \code{"Default"}
 sets the \code{reliability_factor} to 1.
See section 6.14 on page 69 in CNAIM (2017).}
