\description{
This function calculates environmental consequences of failure
(cf. section 7.3, page 75, CNAIM, 2017). Environmental consequences
of failure is used in
the derivation of consequences of failure see \code{\link{cof}}().#' @return Numeric. Financial consequences of failure for LV switchgear
